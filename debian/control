Description: Android Debug Bridge CLI tool
 Android Debug Bridge (adb) is a versatile tool lets you manage the
 state of an emulator instance or Android-powered device. It is a
 client-server program that includes three components:
 .
 A client, which runs on your development machine. You can invoke a
 client from a shell by issuing an adb command. Other Android tools such
 as the ADT plugin and DDMS also create adb clients.
 .
 A server, which runs as a background process on your development
 machine.  The server manages communication between the client and the
 adb daemon running on an emulator or device.
 .
 A daemon, which runs as a background process on each emulator or device
 instance.
